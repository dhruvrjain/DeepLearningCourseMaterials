Variation vs Disciminant Analysis:
----------------------------------
DA:

Covariance - decribes one way in which two features are related (or not related to each other)

Variance vs Covariance- The variation of a feature from it's mean is known as variance, whereas the covariance is a comparison of two different features.

Four variations of DA:
- QDA : Assumes that covariances between different features are unconstrained
- LDA : 
- GNB : Assumes that covariances between distinct features are all zero
- DLDA : Combines LDA and GNB





Support Vector Machines:
------------------------
- A powerful and versatile ML model capable of Linear or Non-Linear classification, regression and even novelty detection.
- Suitable for small to medium-sized non-linear datasets. (Not scalable for large datasets)
- Linear SVM Classification: Two classes can be separated with a single straight line (linearly seperable).
- SVMs are sensitive to feature scales. ( StandardScaler is used to better adapt to feature scaling

Gaussian RBF kernel





Decision trees:
---------------
- One of the most powerful classifiers in today's time.
- Visualize decision trees using 'graphiz' module. (grapphiz.Source.from_file())
- In simpler words, it is like an if-then-else binary tree where the leaf nodes are conclusions(classes) and each inner node is a decision (condition). The decision proceeds from the root node to the leaves.
- Trained using the CART training algorithm.
- Finding the optimal tree is a NP complete problem.
- By default, DTC uses Gini impurity measure, but entropy impurity measure can also be selected.
- To overcome overfitting we can set some regularization parameters (like restricting the depth of the decision tree to make it simple but good enough)
- Can be both Regressor and Classifier.




Ensemble:
---------
- Wisdom of the crowd (Question asked to thousands of random people, aggregate their answers)
- In many cases it is better than the answer of an expert.
- A group of predictors (regressors or classifiers)
